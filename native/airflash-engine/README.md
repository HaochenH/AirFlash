# Native AirPlay engine

Windows-only Rust sidecar; JSONL v1 on stdin/stdout. Diagnostics must not contain keys or PINs. Python UI commands use `start` (live WASAPI); finite tests use `probe` (<=5000ms, gain<=0.1,
440Hz WAV peak<=0.05). EOF cancels all owned work. `stop` and gain changes apply only to the
matching session. `pair` emits `pin_required`; `pair_pin` completes pairing, validates the
accessory signature and writes version-1, user-bound DPAPI credentials. Old pyatv credentials
are neither read nor changed.

Live `start` accepts optional `equalizer` settings (`enabled`, `preamp_db`, ten
`band_gains_db` values). Missing settings bypass EQ. `set_equalizer` accepts the
same settings plus a positive increasing `sequence` for the matching live session;
`equalizer_changed` reports automatic attenuation and effective preamp, and
`equalizer_error` rejects invalid changes without ending playback. Gains must be
finite and within -12..12 dB. Finite probes reject enabled EQ. Both stereo members
receive the same PCM after resampling, EQ, and master gain. Updates crossfade over
20 ms with no additional buffering.

Build with `scripts/build-native.ps1 -Check`. The ignored `soak` test runs two localhost UDP
receivers for 30 wall-clock minutes; it never connects to a speaker. Other tests cover
independent SRP vectors, simulated HAP peers, invalid identities/signatures, HAP records,
RTSP fragmentation/bounds/cancellation, sequence wrap and independent ALAC decoding.

Protocol references (wire fields/behavior, not linked protocol implementations):
- HAP and AirPlay observations in postlund/pyatv (MIT).
- AirPlay PTP profile documented by owntime/libairptp (MIT).
- Apple ALAC codec format via alac-encoder (MIT OR Apache-2.0).
- IEEE 1588 message layouts and RTP sequence/time semantics.

Foundation libraries: RustCrypto sha2/hkdf/ChaCha20-Poly1305, dalek Ed25519/X25519,
num-bigint (SRP arithmetic), Rubato (resampling), alac-encoder, windows-rs.
The code contains no dependency on a third-party complete AirPlay sender.

Limitations: first-device scope is a single native HomePod stereo pair, Windows x64, stereo PCM.
ALAC and persistent pairing have independent/simulated tests; hardware qualification covers
PCM transient authentication. No cross-model 200ms guarantee. The PTP implementation is
an AirPlay unicast master, not a general-purpose IEEE 1588 daemon or full BMCA implementation.

## Headless CLI (`airflash-cli`, Linux)

The crate contains a second, feature-gated binary for non-interactive, headless use:

```bash
cargo build --release --features cli --manifest-path Cargo.toml
```

- `discover` browses `_airplay._tcp.local` / `_raop._tcp.local` over mDNS. `discovery.rs`
  is a self-contained PTR/SRV/A/TXT parser (with compression pointers) plus a small UDP
  transport; no third-party DNS-SD stack is used.
- `start` runs a session in the foreground (one JSON event per line) or detached with
  `--daemon`. Background runs need no tty, no desktop and no service manager: state,
  log and the control socket live under `AIRFLASH_RUNTIME_DIR` (default
  `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/airflash`, else `~/.local/state/airflash`).
- `stop`, `status`, `logs`, `volume` and `gain` talk to the running daemon through a Unix
  socket. `stop` sends SIGTERM, which the daemon turns into a graceful RTSP teardown.
- `pair` performs HAP pairing and stores version-1 credentials for the current user
  (`credentials_unix.rs`, mode 0600, hashed file names).

The daemon reuses `session::probe_with_controls`; it contains no protocol code of its own.

### Audio sources

`--source` selects the capture backend:

| Value | Backend | Platform |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `loopback` | system audio capture | Windows (WASAPI). On Linux it fails explicitly: PipeWire/PulseAudio capture is not implemented yet. |
| `file` | loops a WAV file, resampled to the streaming rate | all (`source.rs`) |
| `simulated` | deterministic test signal, reproducible output | all (`source.rs`) |

`source.rs` mirrors the Windows loopback queue contract (bounded queue, underrun silence,
scheduler recovery, equalizer before master gain, capture metrics), so file and simulated
captures feed the same transport path and report the same metrics as a real capture.

### Tests

```bash
cargo test --features cli          # adds the headless CLI lifecycle suite
cargo clippy --all-targets --features cli -- -D warnings
```

`tests/headless_cli.rs` drives the CLI against a simulated AirPlay receiver (SRP, HAP,
SETUP/RECORD/TEARDOWN, UDP media) and covers daemon start, streaming, control commands,
graceful stop, failure without orphans, SIGTERM, config files and argument validation. It
never contacts a real speaker.
